# text_adventure_game
This is my second attempt at a flask-based text adventure game, this time using SQL! 

## why i made it
I wanted to create a text adventure game since my last attempt didn't live up to my expectations. Although I had tried to make it scalable for adding more to the map, I hadn't considered that multiple users would have to use it at once and had to haphazardly implement it. After doing so, my processing was remarkably slow. This time, I decided to build my game logic on a SQL database using SQLite so that it could more easily handle the large amounts of data that I need it to in order to build a comprehensive world. Ultimately, I wanted to try my hand at the same task as when I had first started programming and see if I had improved (and I certainly did)! 

## how i made it
This is a flask-based application hosted on railway and using SQLite for the backend. I took a lot of inspiration and learned a lot from my last attempt at my text adventure game, which inspired the original idea for the game. 

## challenges
This time I committed to using less AI assistance and programming the majority of it on my own. While this certainly led to a lot of annoyance and what felt like wasted time, in hidinsight I learned a lot about programming and reasoning through those annoying bugs was definitely worth it in the end. I feel like I have created something on my own and I am so proud of it and grateful for the amazing experience! 

## an extra note
This project is being submitted for hack club's shipwrecked event, where qualifiers get to attend a 4-day hackathon on Cathleen Stone Island in Boston harbor in early August!
